This is the API i made to validate my bachelor in relation to the frontend.
It's coded in JAVA and implements JPA, JWT and Spring security.
The development of this app was not that difficult even though I had to learn a lot on the fly, but that's how your learn the best!
The deployment was a struglle on heroku that's why there is at the end numerous commit.
Every credentials was changed after commiting on git to test the deployment.
Overall a great experience, I learned a lot on spring, maven, jpa .
